The subreddits that I have elcted to analyze are the r/collapse and r/futurology pages.

Ostensibly the members of each community have conflicting views of the future of humanity. The futurology subreddit takes a more positive view on the path forward for humans, technology, and science. Members of the collapse community take a more pessimistic view for the decades and centuries ahead. Below are their respective descriptions:

Collapse of Civilization
r/collapse
Discussion regarding the potential collapse of global civilization, defined as a significant decrease in human population and/or political/economic/social complexity over a considerable area, for an extended time. We seek to deepen our understanding of collapse while providing mutual support, not to document every detail of our demise.


Future(s) Studies
r/Futurology
Welcome to r/Futurology, a subreddit devoted to the field of Future(s) Studies and speculation about the development of humanity, technology, and civilization.


The primary purpose of this analysis will be to develop a model that can accurately identify posts as originating from one subreddit or the other. A secondary, further application would be to use this analysis and apply it to other social media posts or content in an effort to us ethe model to assess the author's general view on the future of the Earth and humanity.
